                                                         Logistics Operations Health Assessment Framework
                                                    To benchmark and improve operations at each hierarchical level (Zone, Region, City, Branch), we
                                                    define objective, quantitative questions grouped into weighted categories. Drawing on industry
                                                    scorecard practices[1][2], we propose categories such as Operational Efficiency/Throughput
                                                    (e.g. on-time delivery, lead time)[2][3], Quality/Accuracy (e.g. order accuracy, inventory
                                                    accuracy)[2][4], Safety & Compliance (e.g. audit pass rates, incident rates)[1], Customer Service
                                                    (e.g. satisfaction scores, SLA compliance)[5], and Financial Performance (e.g. cost per order,
                                                    profit margin). Each category is assigned a weight (summing to 100%), and each question yields
                                                    a numeric measure that is converted to a 0–100 score by a formula. For example, logistics KPIs
                                                    like trailer utilization are computed as (used capacity/total capacity)×100[6]. We normalize each
                                                    metric by comparing to a target or baseline (e.g. (Actual/Target)*100 for “higher is better”
                                                    metrics, or (Target/Actual)*100 for “lower is better”), capping at 100. The overall health score is
                                                    then the weighted average of all question scores[7]. Below we list the 50 questions and scoring
                                                    rules for each hierarchy level (to be answered monthly by managers), along with category
                                                    weights. This structure allows internal benchmarking and performance reviews across the
                                                    organization.

                                                 Score Calculation Mechanism
                                                 Each question yields a score (0–100) via its formula. For “higher-is-better” metrics we use
                                                 (Actual/Target)*100 (capped at 100), and for “lower-is-better” metrics we use (Target/Actual)*100.
                                                 (For example, trailer utilization = (used/total)×100[6].) We then multiply each question’s score
                                                 by its weight (in % of the total) and sum across all questions to compute the final health score
                                                 out of 100[7]. In practice this is a weighted average (as in Balanced Scorecard methodology[7]).
                                                 Example: If two questions in a category carry 70% and 30% weight, and their scores are 80 and
                                                 90 respectively, the category score = 0.7×80 + 0.3×90 = 83[7]. The overall score is similarly the
                                                 weighted sum of all question scores.

We base this framework on industry-standard logistics KPIs and scorecard methods[1][2][4][7],
ensuring each question is objective and quantifiable. The cited references illustrate typical
metrics (on-time delivery, inventory accuracy, perfect order rate, etc.) and weighted-scoring
principles used in logistics scorecards[1][5][3][6].
